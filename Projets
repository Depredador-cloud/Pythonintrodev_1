Project	#1
Create	a	simple	calculator	program.	
• Need	to	have	a	way	to	input	data	into	the	program	from	user	input.
- 2	numbers	and	an	operator
• Might	be	easier	to	create	functions	we	can	call?
• Think	about	using	the	IF,	ELIF	statements	we	discussed
Project	#2
Calculate	the	area	of	a	triangle
• Will	need	input	from	the	user,	need	the	height	and	base	values
• Might	want	to	use	"float"	to	be	more	precise	in	the	calculations
• Area	=	(1/2	times	base	times	height)		(1/2	*	B	*	h)
Project	#3
Create	a	multiplicative	for	a	specific	number.	
• (Create	a	multiplication	table	for	one	number	at	a	time)
- Go	up	to	12	(1	x	1;	1	x	2;	1	x	3;	1	x4;	etc...)
• Will	want	to	use	a	loop	for	this	one
• Will	need	user	input	to	populate	the	variables
Project	#4
Create	a	program	to	find	the	largest	number	from	the	given
• Like	before	-	need	user	input
• Can	use	some	IF	statements
• Can	use	some	comparison	operators
Project	#5
Create	a	program	that	takes	a	word	list	and	puts	it	in	alphabetically	order
• Like	before	-	need	user	input
• Don't	forget	about	the	sort()	function
• You	can	print	them	in	a	list	or	each	word	on	a	line
Project	#6
Create	a	dice	rolling	game
• Won’t	need	user	input	this	time	if	you	don’t	want	(not	necessary)
• Think	about	a	while	loop	maybe?
• Seems	like	a	good	place	for	an	IF	and	ELSE	statement
Project	#7
Pick	a	random	word	out	of	a	word	list
• Won’t	need	user	input,	but	will	need	to	either	create	a	word	list	from	code,	or	scratch	(simple	
text	file)
• Remember	how	to	open	files	for	reading
• Will	need	some	randomness in	there	somehow	–	(import	random)
Project	#8
Create	a	Rock,	Paper,	Scissors	game
• Will	need	user	input
• 2	players
• Will	need	to	use	some	IF,	ELIF	statements	for	decision	making
• Print	to	the	screen
• Think	about	how	you	want	to	compare	the	player	selections
